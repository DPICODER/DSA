# Recursion is a concept where a Funtion call its self with the same Definition.

# There are two types of Recursion 
## They are :-
###            1.Calling Time Recursion.
###            2.Returning Time Recursion.
            
Calling Time Recursion :- This Type of Recursion Exectes all The Available Lines
                          of Code Before The Funtion Call.

Returning Time Recursion :- Here The Funtion is Called and After Reaching the 
                            Recursive Limit the funtion Traces it's path Back To The initial funtion

 Example :- in DSA-Notes || Udemy.
 
 

# **IMP :-   Recursion Always uses Stack For Each Funtion call "Unlike Loops the Initialize a Activation Record for Every single Funtion Call in the Stack" .........
